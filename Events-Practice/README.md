# Events in CSharp
Events are, like delegates, a late binding mechanism. 
Events are a way for an object to broadcast (to all interested components in the system) that something has happened.
Any other component can subscribe to the event, and be notified when an event is raised.

Events enable a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs.
The class that sends (or raises) the event is called the publisher and the classes that receive (or handle) the event are called subscribers.

## Events Overview
Events have the following properties:

- The publisher determines when an event is raised; the subscribers determine what action is taken in response to the event.

- An event can have multiple subscribers. A subscriber can handle multiple events from multiple publishers.

- Events that have no subscribers are never raised.

- Events are typically used to signal user actions such as button clicks or menu selections in graphical user interfaces.

- When an event has multiple subscribers, the event handlers are invoked synchronously when an event is raised. To invoke events asynchronously, see Calling  
  Synchronous Methods Asynchronously.

*- In the .NET class library, events are based on the EventHandler delegate and the EventArgs base class.

## Conclusion
Events are a crucial aspect of C# programming, enabling loose coupling between objects and facilitating communication in an event-driven environment.
By understanding how to declare, raise, subscribe to, and handle events, you can implement efficient and responsive applications in C#. Happy coding!
